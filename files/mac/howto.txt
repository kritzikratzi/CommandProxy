Hey there! 

To create a pretty mac-installer you have need to perform a bunch of steps. 
It looks like a lot, but I promise - this hour of work is worth it! 

1. Copy the file template.sparseimage to a location of your choice

2. Mount the image 

3. Rename "App-Name" to whatever your application should be called. 
   Don't worry about the broken icon, it will be fixed when the 
   app is exported. 

4. Right click on the label of the image in finder, choose "Information". 
   Then change "Name and Suffix" according to your application. 

5. Navigate to the mounted image in finder, press Apple+Shift+G. 
   Finder will ask you for the name of a folder, type ".background"

6. You should find the background image in there, edit it with an image 
   editor of your choice and overwrite the file. 
   After clicking back and forth between your harddisk and the image 
   you should see your new disk image as a background. 
   (alternatively navigate to the disk image, press Apple+J and drag 
   an image of your choice onto the "background" section, remember - 
   the background-image must be on that disk image, or only you can
   see it!) 

7. Move the App and the Application folder around so they fit your new
   background image. Add additional files, like a readme, if you feel 
   like it. 

8. Unmount the image 
   HOWEVER, BEFORE YOU DO THAT make sure the toolbar is invisble 
   (Apple+Alt+T) and symbol view is active (Apple+1). Every setting 
   will be saved when the image is opened the next time.  

9. Next time you use commandproxy add the parameter 
   -tempalte=folder/my-image.sparseimage
   Oh - and replace "folder/my-image.sparseimage" with the path to the 
   actual image :)
